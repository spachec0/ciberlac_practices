# LLM01- Prompt Injection

A Prompt Injection Vulnerability occurs when user prompts alter the LLMâ€™s behavior or output in unintended ways. These inputs can affect the model even if they are imperceptible to humans, therefore prompt injections do not need to be human-visible/readable, as long as the content is parsed by the model.
