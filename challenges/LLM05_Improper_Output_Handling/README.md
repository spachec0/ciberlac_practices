# LLM05 - Improper Output Handling

Improper Output Handling occurs when an LLM generates outputs that are not properly validated or constrained, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities. Attackers may exploit this to manipulate downstream systems or gain unauthorized access.

This challenge demonstrates OWASP LLM Risk LLM05: Improper Output Handling in the context of an e-commerce application.
